The year is 2125 and Amazon has built a galactic scale warehouse on the edge of the Orion Spur of the Milky Way Galaxy. The warehouse is a single story space station measuring E9 meters in length and width (1 billion meters, or approximately 3.3 light seconds). The warehouse runs a fleet of up to 10,000 autonomous robots which magnetically attach to the floor of the station, eliminating the need for artificial gravity. Amazon has asked you to find the squared distance between the two closest robots.


Given the position of n robots in the warehouse, write an algorithm to find the squared shortest distance between them.

Input

The function/method consists of three arguments:

numRobots an integer representing the number of robots(n);

positionX, a list of integers representing the x coordinates of the robot's position in meters;

positionY, a list of integers representing the y coordinates of the robot's position in meters.


Output

Return an integer representing the squared shortest distance between the pairs of robots.


Constraints

2 <= numRobots <= 10^5

0 <= positionX[i], positionY[i] <= 10^9
0 <= i < numRobots


Note

The squared distance between a pair of robots with xy coordinates of positions (X1,Y1) and (X2,Y2) is calculated using the formula (X1-X2)^2 + (Y1-Y2)^2.

if the squared distance is 0 between a pair of robots then the robots are present at the same position and the distance will not be considered.


Example

Input:

numRobots = 3

positionX = [0,1,2]

positionY = [0,1,4]


Output:

2


Explanation

There are 3 robots with positions of x coordinates [0,1,2] and y coordinates = [0,1,4].

The robots have the xy coordinates of positions of (0,0), (1, 1) and (2,4). The closest robots are (0, 0) and (1,1), and closest squared Euclidean distance is (1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2 = 2.

 

Example

Input:

numRobots = 3

positionX = [0,2,0]

positionY = [0,3,0]


Output:

13


Explanation

There are 3 robots (0, 0), (2, 3) and (0, 0)

Here robot1 and robot3 are at the same position, so the distance is not considered. 

The closest squared Euclidean distance is (0-2)^2 + (0-3)^2 = 13.
